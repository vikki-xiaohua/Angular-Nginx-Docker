## Docker Multi-stage Builds

With multi-stage builds, you use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile. Each FROM instruction can use a different base, and each of them begins a new stage of the build. You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you don¡¯t want in the final image. To show how this works, let¡¯s adapt the Dockerfile from the previous section to use multi-stage builds.


**The end result is the same tiny production image as before, with a significant reduction in complexity. **
